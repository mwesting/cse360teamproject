Title Justification
-t
Godzilla Song
-l
This is Left justification
What do you get when you take Godzilla to the mall?
He scares all the children and shreds all the pillows
And knocks over walls
His emerald eyes, they sparkle and shine
As he eats the food court and steals half my fries
-c
This is centered justification
That's what you get when 
-l
-i
This is indented
-i
you take Godzilla to the mall
What do you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom?
The next line will use the e flag to make a blank line
-e
He rings the bell and she looks out the window, and calls the cops
Now there will be blocking
-b
I try to explain that he's mostly tame
As long as there's pizza and video games
That's what you get when you take Godzilla to meet your mom
While everyone else is running and screaming
The next line is the n flag to end the blocking
-n
I just love being with you
This is just a default line 
The next lines will be right justified
-r
This is right justified
I guess they don't see all the things that I'm seein'
That make you so uniquely you, you, you, you
What do you get when you meet Godzilla and fall in love?
